1 READ ME FIRST
    This is the NXP Code Signing Tool (CST) for the High
    Assurance Boot (HAB) library and the Advanced High Assurance
    Boot (AHAB) subsystem. The CST provides software code
    signing support designed for use with NXP processors that
    integrate the HAB library in the internal boot ROM or the
    AHAB subsystem. This release provides the features required
    for the code signing for SoC supporting HAB version 3,
    HAB version 4 and AHAB.

1.1 REQUIREMENTS
    This release supports Linux and Windows hosts
    For Linux, the CST is known to work on Ubuntu 14.04 and later.
    For Windows, the CST is known to work on Windows 7 and later

    Most Linux distributions should work but they have not been fully
    tested. If you run into library problems, see section 2.1 below
    for instructions on how to relink CST.

1.2 PROBLEM REPORTING INSTRUCTIONS
    Problems with this release may be reported to your local NXP
    representative or at community.nxp.com.


2 NEW FEATURES & Fixes
    The following is included in this release:

2.1 Encrypted Boot support
    This version of CST allows the user to relink the executable
    to include support for generating encrypted boot images.

    To relink on Ubuntu 14.04 machines, please first install binutils 2.26:
        sudo apt-get install binutils-2.26
        export PATH=/usr/lib/binutils-2.26/bin:${PATH}

    To relink on 32 bit Linux machines:
       This requires the GCC compiler and the OpenSSL header files and
       library. For example on Ubuntu machines:
       sudo apt-get install gcc libssl-dev

       cd <CST install directory>/code/back_end/src
       gcc -o cst -I ../hdr -L ../../../linux32/lib *.c \
           -lfrontend -lcrypto
       cp cst ../../../linux32

    To relink on 64 bit Linux machines:
       This requires the GCC compiler and the OpenSSL header files and
       library. For example on Ubuntu machines:
       sudo apt-get install gcc libssl-dev

       cd <CST install directory/code/back_end/src
       gcc -o cst -I ../hdr -L ../../../linux64/lib *.c -lfrontend -lcrypto
       cp cst ../../../linux64

    To relink on Windows machines:
       This requires the MINGW compiler and OpenSSL header files and
       library. The easiest way to get them is to install Cygwin

       cd <CST install directory/code/back_end/src
       i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o cst.exe -I ../hdr -L ../../../mingw32/lib \
         *.c -lfrontend -lcrypto -static -lgdi32 -lws2_32 -lz
       cp cst.exe ../../../mingw32

       If cst.exe crashes, please try to relink with the small C snippet
       applink.c provided by OpenSSL (if applicable to your platform).
       To do so, please add the compilation flag -DUSE_APPLINK.

       i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -o cst.exe -I ../hdr -L ../../../mingw32/lib \
         *.c -lfrontend -lcrypto -static -lgdi32 -lws2_32 -lz -DUSE_APPLINK

        Please refer to https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.0/crypto/OPENSSL_Applink.html
        and https://www.openssl.org/docs/faq.html#PROG3

    This was added in CST 2.3.0

    Please note that there was an issue in 3.0.1 that prevented this
    feature from working.

2.2 64 bit native binaries
    CST now includes both 32 and 64 bit native binaries. They are
    located in the linux32 and linux64 directories, respectively.

    This was added in CST 2.3.0

2.3 Issue INIT RNG command
    On closed i.MX devices with CAAM, HAB will initialize the RNG by
    default. If the RNG trim fuses have not been set correctly, RNG
    iniatialization will fail, causing the boot to fail.

    To prevent HAB from initializing the RNG, you can add an UNLOCK
    command to the CST input file.

    This version of CST will add that command automatically if the CSF
    includes "Engine = CAAM" in the header unless
    explicitly told otherwise. The way to disable this behavior is to
    add the following to the CST input file:
        [Init]
             Engine = CAAM
             Features = RNG

    This was added in CST 2.3.1, fixed in 2.3.2

2.4 Changed CST input file handling
    Previous versions of CST got the CSF input file on standard
    input. This has changed. Now the input filename is supplied as a
    command line argument.

    Example:
       cst --output csf.bin --input input.csf

    This was added in CST 2.3.2

2.5 Added unlock command for Manufacturing Protection
    The new unlock command will cause HAB to keep the manufacturing
    protection key in internal CAAM memory after boot.

    This was added in CST 2.3.2

2.6 Windows support
    This version of CST adds support for Microsoft Windows.

    This was added in CST 2.3.3

2.7 Removed several commands
    This version of CST removed support for the following commands:
        Write Data
        Clear Mask
        Set Mask
        Check All Clear
        Check All Set
        Check Any Clear
        Check Any Set
        Set MID

    This was added in CST 2.3.3

2.8 AHAB support
    This version of CST adds support for AHAB.

    This was added in CST 3.0.0

2.9 ECDSA support for HAB4
    This version of CST adds support for ECDSA for HAB4.
    ECDSA support was added in HAB 4.5

    This was added in CST 3.1.0

3.0 OpenSSL 1.1.0
    This version of CST adds support for OpenSSL 1.1.0.
    Even if OpenSSL 1.0.2 is known to work with CST, OpenSSL 1.1.0
    or later is recommended.

    This was added in CST 3.1.0
