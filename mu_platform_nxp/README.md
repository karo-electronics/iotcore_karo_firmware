## About

This document will walkthrough the layout of a "typical" project Mu repo using iMX8 as a sample platform.

[Repo Link](https://github.com/microsoft/mu)

## TL;DR

1. Run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to check out all the submodules.
2. Run `python {Platform}/{Device}/PlatformBuild.py --setup` to set up the build environment. Includes fetching Nuget dependencies and synchronizing submodules.
3. Run `python {Platform}/{Device}/PlatformBuild.py` to invoke the build process.

# MU Repos

## NXP Platform

This is platform repo, which is the root repository in which all the other submodules are located. This is also where code specific to the platform or devices would be located, including `PlatformBuild.py` and `PlatformBuildWorker.py`.

## [Silicon/ARM/NXP](https://github.com/ms-iot/MU_SILICON_NXP.git)

Silicon code provided from a manufacturer is kept in its own submodule so it can be maintained seperately from platform code.

## [MU_BASECORE](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu_basecore)

This is the main repo. Contains the guts of the build system as well as core UEFI code, forked from TianoCore.

## [Silicon/ARM/MU_TIANO](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu_silicon_arm_tiano)

Silicon code from TianoCore has been broken out into indivudal submodules. iMX8 is ARM, so we need this submodule. An Intel project would include [Intel/MU_TIANO](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu_silicon_intel_tiano).

## [Common/MU_TIANO](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu_tiano_plus )

Additional, optional libraries and tools forked from TianoCore.

## [Common/MU](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu_plus)

Additional, optional libraries and tools we've added to make MU great!

# Build Environment

Part of Project Mu is a major improvement to the build environment in TianoCore
Documentation of the build system is still on its way.

## Conf

NXP

# Pip modules

## [mu_python_library](https://pypi.org/project/mu-python-library/)

Python files describing miscellaneous components (EDKII, TPM, etc.)

## [mu_environment](https://pypi.org/project/mu-environment/)

This is the code that PlatformBuild.py calls in to that sets up the build environment.

## [mu_build](https://pypi.org/project/mu-build/)

Command line interface that fetches dependencies and builds each module specified by a descriptor file. See [MU_BASECORE](https://github.com/Microsoft/mu_basecore/blob/release/201808/RepoDetails.md) as an example.

## Troubleshooting

To forcibly install the latest version of mu_environment:
`pip install --upgrade mu_environment --force-reinstall --no-cache-dir`

Since mu_environment has a dependency on mu_python_library, it should be updated through this command as well. If they are not, the same command can be run for mu_python_library.

# Setup Info for iMX8

- `sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make python3 python3-pip git mono-devel`
    - Minimum Python version is 3.6
    - Minimum git version 2.11
- `git clone https://github.com/ms-iot/MU_PLATFORM_NXP`
- Install pip modules for build:
    - `pip3 install -r requirements.txt --upgrade`
- Change into the directory you just cloned and run:
    - `git submodule update --init --recursive`
- Download [Linaro AARCH 64 GCC 7.2.1](https://releases.linaro.org/components/toolchain/binaries/7.2-2017.11/aarch64-linux-gnu/)
    - Set GCC5_AARCH64_PREFIX to this path
        - `tar -xf gcc-linaro-7.2.1-2017.11-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
        - `export GCC5_AARCH64_PREFIX=$PWD/gcc-linaro-7.2.1-2017.11-x86_64_aarch64-linux-gnu/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-`
- `python3 NXP/MCIMX8M_EVK_4GB/PlatformBuild.py --setup`
    - This fetches any dependencies via NuGet and synchronizes submodules
- `rm -r Build; rm -r Conf; python3 NXP/MCIMX8M_EVK_4GB/PlatformBuild.py TOOL_CHAIN_TAG=GCC5 BUILDREPORTING=TRUE BUILDREPORT_TYPES="PCD"`
    - Removing Build and Conf directories ensures that you aren't accidentally keeping around configuration files and autogen build files that need to be updated.
    - Specify the `TOOL_CHAIN_TAG` either here or in `NXP/Conf/Target.template.ms`
    - Build reports are placed in the `Build` folder on a successful build and contain a complete list of every module that was built and what the PCDs were set to.

    - The [drivers](https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers) that actually worked for me
    - Serial configuration
        - Speed = 921600
        - Data bits = 8
        - Stop bits = 1
        - Parity = None
        - Flow Control = XON/XOFF
