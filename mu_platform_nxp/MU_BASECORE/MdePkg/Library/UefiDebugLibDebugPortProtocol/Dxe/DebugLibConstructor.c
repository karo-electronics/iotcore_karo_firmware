/** @file
  UEFI Dxe DebugLib constructor that gets the pointers to the system table and boot services table
  This is needed to prevent a circular dependency between UefiBootServices lib and DebugLib

  Differs from the Runtime constructor in that it does not need to register a callback on
  ExitBootServices to close off protocol calls
