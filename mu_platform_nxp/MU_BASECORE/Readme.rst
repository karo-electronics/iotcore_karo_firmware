Branch Changes - release/201903
===============================

Breaking Changes-dev
--------------------

- Edk2ToolHelper no longer has logic for dependencies. This is easily replaced, but convenient to leave out while GenerateCapsule is being refactored to remove reliance on older compiled tools.

Main Changes-dev
----------------

- None

Bug Fixes-dev
-------------

- None

1903_RefBoot Changes
--------------------

Platform Changes
- Remove the use of PcdPeiCoreMaxFvSupported, PcdPeiCoreMaxPeimPerFv and PcdPeiCoreMaxPpiSupported in platform code as they have been removed for BZ1405.
- Add a LibraryClass for MmServicesTableLib to satisfy new library requirement in FaultTolerantWrite.
- Override ResetSystemLib with RuntimeResetSystemLib in CapsuleRuntimeDxe.
- Change "COMPONENT_TYPE = Microcode" to "MODULE_TYPE = USER_DEFINED" for ucode modules. All EDK build definitions have been dropped from EDK2.
- Remove all references to $(EFI_SOURCE). This define is no longer set anywhere.

1903_CIBuild Changes
--------------------

- Add FaultTolerantWriteStandaloneMm and VariableStandaloneMm to the CI ignore list. Cannot be built without StandaloneMmPkg.
- Move LockBoxLibPei and add Null lib to satisfy modules that aren't IA32 or X64 compatible.
- Update all references to EfiResetSystem to ResetSystem to match upstream.

1903_Rebase Changes
-------------------

Source Commit from 201811: 713696c6bfaffbf2481aa13518268725e0c4b30c

- *.template.ms - When do we perform this?
- BmBoot.c - Changed to BmReportLoadFailure() for reporting. Lost some data. Restore if still required.
- NvmExpressHci.c - Near the bottom, is this ReportStatusCode in a bad place? Bad merge?
- ResetSystemLib.h - Switch from EfiResetSystem to ResetSystem. Make sure everything still works.
- Make sure bb9faf8d02a7405a163592798a6fa3a18926b18b changes for BaseTools/Source are preserved.
- Evaluate the effects of dropping 8083ded2580ff01ceaa88fcd2c4a900b195f604e for ResetSystem.
- Trim.py - TianoCore fix slightly different than Mu fix. Confirmed compatible.
- String.c - Take Tiano implementation of Base64 encode/decode.
- SafeString.c - Dropped the custom call to AsciiToUpper(). Replaced with Tiano fix.
