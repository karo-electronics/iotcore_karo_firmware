  Mark a variable that will become read-only after leaving the DXE phase of execution.
  Write request coming from SMM environment through EFI_SMM_VARIABLE_PROTOCOL is allowed.

  @param[in] This          The VARIABLE_LOCK_PROTOCOL instance.
  @param[in] VariableName  A pointer to the variable name that will be made read-only subsequently.
  @param[in] VendorGuid    A pointer to the vendor GUID that will be made read-only subsequently.

  @retval EFI_SUCCESS           The variable specified by the VariableName and the VendorGuid was marked
                                as pending to be read-only.
  @retval EFI_INVALID_PARAMETER VariableName or VendorGuid is NULL.
                                Or VariableName is an empty string.

                                already been signaled.
  @retval EFI_OUT_OF_RESOURCES  There is not enough resource to hold the lock request.
